      <p><strong>Dear Friends of Tory DeOrian, we want to establish an endowed named scholarship in our Art Department at Cal State East Bay in Tory DeOrian's name.</strong></p><p>
        This means that every year the art department would award a scholarship to a student in Tory's name. To do this we need to raise a minimum of $25000. Every little bit will help to reach out goal.</p>
      <p>Tory did a lot of work for Snapchat, Taco Bell, Starbucks. If you know anyone that works for these companies please let us know and help us reach out to them</p>

      Tory was a vibrant, beaming girl who lit up every room she walked in to. She loved to design and create, and has spent her life filling the world with her beautiful art. She lived by a simple rule, and that was to be positive and be kind. Her favorite quote was "<em>Live in the sunshine, swim the sea, drink the wild air.</em>" by Ralph Waldo Emerson.
